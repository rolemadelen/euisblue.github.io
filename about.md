I'm a ~~future~~ developer working in Japan as a foreign language teacher in public elementary schools. I love to break things, analyze things, and look deep into the bottom layer of things.

When I was 10, my sister showed me this little program that she wrote. She told me to click this one button and something popped up; a black screen with two words, `You idiot`. 

This is how I entered the world of IT, and fortunately, I'll soon work as a frontend developer in Japan.

Please reach out if you have any questions ðŸ™‚
