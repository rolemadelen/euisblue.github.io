Hi. I’m **Jione Eu** who goes by **Jii**. 

I graduated from [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) with a degree in 
Cognitive Science Specialization in Human Computer Interaction in 2019.
Today, I’m pursuing to become a Rails developer.

I have no talent in writing that I’m just running this blog as a learning journal of sorts. 
Actually, this is the reason why I’m writing same posts in three different languages, because translating should help writing in one or the other, right?

If you find any errors, typos, or awkward phrases on my posts, please points them out and let me know via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jioneeu){:target="\_blank"}.

Thank you.
