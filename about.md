Hi. I’m **Jione Eu** who goes by **Jii**. 

I graduated from [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) in 2019 with [B.S. Cognitive Science with a Specialization in Human Computer and Interaction](http://cogsci.ucsd.edu/undergraduates/major/design-interaction.html) degree.

I was born in Korea, raised in the States, and now working in Japan as a Foreign Language Teacher in elementary school.

Today, I’m spending all my spare times in programming, algorithms, data structures, and doing side projects pursuing to become a software developer.

I'm running a [Study with me](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8hY3wjYlK2U9W4fqKN598Q?view_as=subscriber) channel as a form of motivation to myself. Feel free to join and study with me :)

Thank you.
