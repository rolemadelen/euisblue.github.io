Hi, I'm [@ipflegen](https://github.com/ipflegen) (Jii Eu), a doodler, lifelong learner, cat lover, 
sometime procrastinator and a former elementary school English teacher in Japan. 

I'm currently working at a startup company based in Yokohama as a junior frontend engineer. 

I stuided [Mathematics-Computer Science](https://www.math.ucsd.edu/~handbook/undergraduate/ma30-math-computer-science-b-s/) at [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu) (UCSD)
but switched to Cognitive Science during my 3rd year at UCSD and graduated with [B.S. Human Computer Interaction](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/undergraduates/major/design-interaction.html).

> 🤖 Fun fact: when I switched my major to HCI, I thought HCI was machine learning related and was expecting to 
> learn about robotics and AI but nope. It was UI/UX 😝
