## **DCP #3** <a id="dcp3"></a>
This problem was asked by Google.

Given the root to a binary tree, implement serialize(root), which serializes the tree into a string, and deserialize(s), which deserializes the string back into the tree.

For example, given the following Node class

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```
The following test should pass:

```python
node = Node('root', Node('left', Node('left.left')), Node('right'))
assert deserialize(serialize(node)).left.left.val == 'left.left'
```

<br>

## **My Solution**

```ruby
class Node
    attr_accessor :val, :left, :right

    def initialize(val, left=nil, right=nil)
        @val = val
        @left = left
        @right = right
    end
end

def serialize(node)
    if node == nil 
        return 'nil'
    end

    left_str = serialize(node.left)
    right_str = serialize(node.right)

    return "#{node.val} #{left_str} #{right_str}"
end

def deserialize(node)
    tokens = node.split(' ')

    des_helper tokens
end

def des_helper(tokens)
    current = tokens.shift

    if current == 'nil'
        return nil
    end

    curr_node = Node.new(current)
    curr_node.left = des_helper(tokens)
    curr_node.right = des_helper(tokens)

    return curr_node
end
```

<br>

## **Explanation**

I first attempted going for a `DFS` and I failed miserably (now that I think of it, it actually worked but just didn't realize my results were correct) so I changed my route to `preorder` traversal.

Preorder is one of three traversals to go through each nodes in a tree and it works like this:
1. visit
2. travel left
3. travel right

I used the above method to accomplish `serialize(node)` method.

```ruby
def serialize(node)
    # terminating condition
    if node == nil 
        return 'nil'
    end

    # get the value of current node's left child
    left_str = serialize(node.left)
    # get the value current node's right child
    right_str = serialize(node.right)

    # concatenate current node's two childs value after the current
    # separate each nodes with a space
    return "#{node.val} #{left_str} #{right_str}"
end
```

<br>

Now that we serialized a binary tree, we need to deserialize them.

In order to do that, our `deserialize(s)` must go follow the same path the serilaization went through to recreate the tree.

Since `preorder` was the method used in serialization, we use same method for deserialization.

But first, we separate each nodes in a string.

```ruby
def deserialize(s)
    # separate nodes from a string and call the helper function
    tokens = s.split(' ')
    des_helper tokens
end
```
<br>

We then insert each node into a tree **starting from the front node one by one**.
This sounds like a `Queue` doesn't it?

So I used `.first` and `.shift` methods in an Array to use the array `tokens` like a queue.

```ruby
def des_helper(tokens)
    # pop the queue
    current = tokens.shift

    if current == 'nil'
        return nil
    end

    # create a root node
    curr_node = Node.new(current)
    # recursively read and store current node's left and right nodes
    curr_node.left = des_helper(tokens)
    curr_node.right = des_helper(tokens)

    # return the root of the recreated tree
    return curr_node
end
```

Time Complexity is **O(n)** since we need to visit every nodes in a binary tree including the `nil`. <br>
Space complexity is also **O(n)** because of the stack frame added during the recursion procedure.
