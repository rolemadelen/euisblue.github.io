## **DCP #3**

Given the root to a binary tree, implement serialize(root), which serializes the tree into a string, and deserialize(s), which deserializes the string back into the tree.

For example, given the following Node class
```py
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```
The following test should pass:

```py
node = Node('root', Node('left', Node('left.left')), Node('right'))
assert deserialize(serialize(node)).left.left.val == 'left.left'
```

<div class="divider"></div>

## **Serialization and Deserialization?**
**Serialization** is a process of storing a tree into a file so that it can be restored later.
This restoring process is called **Deserialization**.

Let's take a look at the sample binary tree given by this problem.
```
       root
     /      \
    L        R
  /   \    /   \
 LL   #   #     #       # <-- nil / empty child
/  \
#  #
```

It's important to keep track of `nil` because we need to serialize them as well.
If we serialize this tree without the empty child, we'll get
```
root L LL R
```
And this is a problem, because try to deserialize it.
```
       root
     /
    L
  /   \
 LL   R
```

So with the empty child, the serialization will give us
```
root L LL # # # R # #
```
and we'll be able restore the same tree when we deserialize it.

<div class="divider"></div>

## **Solution: Ruby**

I re-created the class shown above in Python to Ruby.
```rb
class Node
  attr_accessor :val, :left, :right

  def initialize(val, left=nil, right=nil)
    @val = val
    @left = left
    @right = right
  end
end
```

I used `preorder` traversal to serialize the binary tree. I also used a helper method `encode` to
save the data. If we were to read and write from a file, this helper method is not need it.
```rb
def serialize(root)
  vals = []
  encode = ->(node, vals) {
    if node == nil
      vals.push('x')
    else
      vals.push(node.val)
      encode.call(node.left, vals)
      encode.call(node.right, vals)
    end
  }

  return (encode.call(root, vals)).join(' ')
end
```

Now that we have a serialized binary tree in a string format, all we need to do is read each data
 from the head and put it back into a tree.

Here again I used a `preorder` method to recreate the binary tree.
```rb
def deserialize(serialized_str)
  vals = serialized_str.split()
  decode = -> (vals) {
    data = vals.shift

    if data == 'x'
      return nil
    end

    node = Node.new(data)
    node.left = decode.call(vals)
    node.right = decode.call(vals)
    return node  
  }

  return decode.call(vals)
end
```
```rb
root = Node.new('root', 
                Node.new('left', Node.new('left.left')), 
                Node.new('right'))
puts deserialize(serialize(root)).left.left.val

# left.left
```

<div class="divider"></div>
