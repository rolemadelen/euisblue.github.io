## **DCP #2**
Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

Follow-up: what if you can't use division?

<div class="divider"></div>

## **Solution 1 - with Division**

I used `.inject(:*)` to get the product of all numbers in the list. Then, I divided this number 
with each element in the list to get the new array.

```rb
def dcp2(arr)
  product = arr.inject(:*) 
  arr.each_with_index do |x, i|
    arr[i] = product/x
  end
end

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
new_arr = dcp2(arr)
print "#{new_arr}\n"
```

## **Solution 2 - without Division**

I used nested loops and multiplied numbers if their index is different.
This is the naive solution, which works in O(n^2) time.

```rb
# Time Complexity: O(n^2)
# Space Complexity: O(1)
def dcp2(arr)
  size = arr.size
  new_arr = [1]*size

  for i in 0...size
    for j in 0...size
      next if j == i
      new_arr[i] *= arr[j]
    end
  end

  new_arr
end

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
new_arr = dcp2(arr)
print "#{new_arr}\n"
```

## **Solution 3 - without Division**

This one uses more memory but slightly faster than the above solution. It is still O(n^2) 
because of `.inject`.

```rb
# Time Complexity: O(n^2)
# Space Complexity: O(n)
def dcp2(arr)
  storage = arr.clone
  new_arr = []

  arr.each do
    x = storage.shift()
    new_arr.push(storage.inject(:*))
    storage.push(x)
  end

  new_arr
end

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
new_arr = dcp2(arr)
print "#{new_arr}\n"
```

## Benchmark

I created 10000 random values to test with and ran a benchmark.

```rb
n = 10000
arr = (1..n).map { rand }
Benchmark.bm do |x|
  x.report("solution1: ") { dcp2_div(arr) }
  x.report("solution2: ") { dcp2_naive(arr) }
  x.report("solution3: ") { dcp2_better?(arr) }
end
```
```
              user     system      total        real
solution1:   0.001754   0.000000   0.001754 (  0.001751)
solution2:   9.805303   0.007980   9.813283 (  9.903017)
solution3:   6.409976   0.008046   6.418022 (  6.460229)
```
Solution 1 (using the division operation) is obivously the fastest because it has O(n) time.

Solution 2 and 3 are both O(n^2) but latter is faster. For solution 2, I'm iterating every
 element and mulitplying it using the `*` operator but `.inject` uses binary operation to combine
 all elements. So I'm assuming this is the part where it makes the solution 3 a bit faster.
