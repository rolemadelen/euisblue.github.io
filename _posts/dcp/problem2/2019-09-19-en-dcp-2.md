## **DCP #2**  <a id="dcp2"></a>
This problem was asked by Uber.

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

Follow-up: what if you can't use division?

## **My Solution**
[C Solution](https://github.com/muicode/DCP/blob/master/problem2/dcp2.c)

### **With Division**
When division is allowed, we can simply find the product of all numbers and divide by `i`<sup>th</sup> element.

```ruby
def with_div(arr)
    product = arr.inject(:*)
    n = arr.length
    for i in (0 ... n)
        arr[i] = product/arr[i]
    end
    arr
end
```

Time Complexity: **O(n)** <br>
Space Complexity: **O(1)**

### **Without Division**
My first attempt was to iterate all numbers and simply multiply them except one at the `i`.

```ruby
def without_div(arr)
    n = arr.length
    ans = []

    for i in (0 ... n)
        prod = 1
        for j in (0 ... n)
            if j != i
                prod *= arr[j]
            end
        end
        ans.insert(i, prod)
    end
    ans
end
```

Time Complexity: **O(n^2)** <br>
Space Complexity: **O(n)**

My second attempt, which is sort of ruby way, is basically same as my first attempt.

```ruby
def wo_division2(arr)
    n = arr.length
    ans = [] * n
    
    for i in (0 ... n)
        ans[i] = (arr - [arr[i]]).inject(:*)
    end
    ans
end
```

Time Complexity: **O(n^2)** <br>
Space Complexity: **O(n)**

I couldn't think of any solutions other than quadratic, but there are many people who have solved this in linear time.
