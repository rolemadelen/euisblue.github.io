## **DCP 7**

Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26, and an encoded message, count the number of ways it can be decoded.

For example, the message '111' would give 3, since it could be decoded as 'aaa', 'ka', and 'ak'.

You can assume that the messages are decodable. For example, '001' is not allowed.

<div class="divider"></div>

## **Solution**

`dp[i]` represents the total number of decodes in first `i` characters of the message.

Given that the message is always decodable, we can start with `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` set to 1.
```rb
dp = Array.new(msg.size+1, 0)
dp[0] = dp[1] = 1
```

`dp[i+1]` at least has as many decodes as `dp[i]` if current character is a valid character.
```rb
if msg[i] != '0'
  dp[i+1] = dp[i]
end
```

Now we need to check if `msg[i-1] + msg[i]` is in the mapping (10 ~ 26). 
If this is a vaild mapping, we can add `dp[i-1]`.
```rb
x = msg[(i-1)..i)].to_i
if msg[i-1] != '0' and (x >= 10 and x <= 26)
  dp[i+1] += dp[i-1]
end
```

And this is it.  The last element of `dp` should be the total number of decodes of the given message.

```rb
def dcp(msg)
  dp = Array.new(msg.size+1, 0)
  dp[0] = dp[1] = 1

  for i in 1...msg.size
    if msg[i] != '0'
      dp[i+1] = dp[i]
    end

    x = msg[(i-1)..i)].to_i
    if msg[i-1] != '0' and (x >= 10 and x <= 26)
      dp[i+1] += dp[i-1]
    end
  end

  return dp.last
end
```
