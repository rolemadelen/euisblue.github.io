## What is DCP?
When you subscribe to [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com), you will receive a coding problem every day to
solve it. 

These problems were actually asked by top companies during a coding interview, so it should be good practice if you're
preparing for a job interview. Even if you're not, I believe this type of problem will help you to think more logically so
I'm going to give it a shot.

I will be using C/C++ and Ruby, the one I'm currently studying, to solve problems.

However, there's no point of posting two same codes just in different languages so I'll only post Ruby code here.

If you want to look at my C or C++ code solutions, please visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/muicode/DCP).

By the way, if you're a premium member at DCP, they will send you the solution the following day; however, I am not. 
So if you find any errors in my code or you have a better solution, please share it with me.

Well then, here it goes the first problem.

## DCP #1  <a id="dcp1"></a>
This problem was recently asked by Google.

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

## My Solution
[C++ Implementation](https://github.com/muicode/DCP/blob/master/problem1/problem1.cpp)

### Bruteforce

We can use brute force type algorithm here to find whether two values sum up to `k`.

```ruby
def bruteforce(arr, k)
    n = arr.size

    for i in (0 ... n - 1)
        for j in (i + 1 ... n)
            if arr[i] + arr[j] == k
                puts "found: #{arr[i]} + #{arr[j]} = #{k}"
                return
            end
        end
    end
    puts "none exists"
end
```

Starting from the first element, we can add rest of them one by one and see if it equals to `k`.
If it dose we return True and False if not.

The time complexity for this algorithm would be **O(n^2)**.

Since we didn't use any extra array, the space complexity is **O(1)**.

<br>

### One-Pass

Brute force algorithm tends to get slower as data gets bigger (obviously its O(n^2) right?).

Lets solve it with one-pass.

```ruby
def one_pass(arr, k)
    m = Hash.new(0)

    arr.each do |n|
        if m.has_key? (k - n)
            puts "found: #{k - n} + #{n} = #{k}"
            return
        else
            m[n] = (k - n)
        end
    end
    puts "none exists"
end
```

As we iterate through each element in the array, we see if the value `n` matches its key, `k - n`.
We return True if it does exist, if not add `n` and `k - n` as a new key and value pair to its hash.

Lets take a look at the time complexity.

The implementation of `[]` method in `Hash` looks like the following:

```ruby
# source: https://apidock.com/ruby/v2_5_5/Hash/%5B%5D

VALUE
rb_hash_aref(VALUE hash, VALUE key)
{
    st_data_t val;

    if (!RHASH(hash)->ntbl || !st_lookup(RHASH(hash)->ntbl, key, &val)) {
        return rb_hash_default_value(hash, key);
    }
    return (VALUE)val;
}
```

I'm not quite sure how `st_lookup` is implemented but I'm going to assume its O(1) since its a lookup table.

`has_key` method is implemented like the below:

```ruby
# source: https://apidock.com/ruby/v2_5_5/Hash/has_key%3F

VALUE
rb_hash_has_key(VALUE hash, VALUE key)
{
    if (!RHASH(hash)->ntbl)
        return Qfalse;
    if (st_lookup(RHASH(hash)->ntbl, key, 0)) {
        return Qtrue;
    }
    return Qfalse;
}
```

O(1) as it is.

So, our one-pass implementation has the time complexity of **O(n)** with the space complexity being **O(1)** at best and **O(n)** at worst.
