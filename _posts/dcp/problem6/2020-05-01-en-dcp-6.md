## **DCP 6**

An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list. Instead of each node holding `next` and `prev` fields, it holds a field named `both`, which is an XOR of the next node and the previous node. Implement an XOR linked list; it has an `add(element)` which adds the element to the end, and a `get(index)` which returns the node at index.

If using a language that has no pointers (such as Python), you can assume you have access to `get_pointer` and `dereference_pointer` functions that converts between nodes and memory addresses.

## **XOR Linked List?**
Doubly linke list uses `prev` and `next` nodes to link one before and after the current node.
**XOR Linked list**, however, only **uses single node** to link previous and next nodes.
This node stores the computed value of `address of prev XOR address of next`. So I call it `xpn`.

In XOR linked list, we need two information to traverse the node: addr(prev) and xpn(curr).
Given `A -> B -> C -> D`, let's say we're on `B` and we want to get `C`.  

We can get `C` by doing `addr(A) ^ B.xpn`.

`B.xpn` is same as `addr(A) ^ addr(C)`. Then the above expression becomes
`addr(A) ^ addr(A) ^ addr(C)` which becomes `0 ^ addr(C)` and this is just `addr(C)`.

## **Solution**

`get_pointer` method returns the `object_id` of an object which is then used like a memory address.
`deref_pointer` method is used to convert the memory back to the object. Hence, it
works as if we're dereferencing a pointer.

```rb
def get_pointer(obj)
  return obj.object_id
end

def deref_pointer(id)
  return ObjectSpace._id2ref(id)
end
```

Then I created a `Node` class used for XOR Linked list.
```rb
class Node
  # XOR of previous and next
  attr_accessor :xpn

  def initialize(data)
    @xpn = nil
    @data = data
  end

  def get_data
    @data
  end
end
```

And here's the implementation for XOR Linked List.
```rb
class XORList
  attr_writer :head

# First node's xpn = head ^ 0 (but I used nil)
  def initialize(data)
    @head = Node.new(data)
    @head.xpn = get_pointer(@head) ^ get_pointer(nil)
  end

  def add(data)
    prev_addr = get_pointer(nil)
    curr = @head
    next_node = deref_pointer(prev_addr ^ curr.xpn)

    while next_node != curr and next_node != nil
      prev_addr = get_pointer(curr)
      curr = next_node
      next_node = deref_pointer(prev_addr ^ curr.xpn)
    end

    new_node = Node.new(data)

    curr.xpn = prev_addr ^ get_pointer(new_node)
    new_node.xpn = get_pointer(curr) ^ get_pointer(nil)
  end

  def get(index)
    return @head if index == 0

    prev_addr = get_pointer(nil)
    curr = @head

    for i in 0...index
      next_node = deref_pointer(prev_addr ^ curr.xpn)
      prev_addr = get_pointer(curr)
      curr = next_node
    end

    return curr
  end
end
```
