## **DCP #8**
This problem was asked by Google.

A unival tree (which stands for "universal value") is a tree where all nodes under it have the same value.

Given the root to a binary tree, count the number of unival subtrees.

For example, the following tree has 5 unival subtrees:
```
   b
  / \
 a   b        # a => 1
    / \
   a   b      # a => 2, b => 3
  / \
 a   a        # a => 4, a => 5
```
