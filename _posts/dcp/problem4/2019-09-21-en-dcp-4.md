## **DCP #4** <a id="dcp4"></a>
This problem was asked by Stripe.

Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.

For example, the input [3, 4, -1, 1] should give 2. The input [1, 2, 0] should give 3.

You can modify the input array in-place.

## **My Solution**
Time Complexity / Space Complexity

### O(n) / O(max(n, largest element in n))
```ruby
def dcp4(input)
    max = input.max                   # linear
    b = ([*1 .. max] - input)

    if b.empty?                       # constant
        return max+1 
    end

    b.first                           # constant
end
```

<br>

### O(n) / O(1)
```ruby
def dcp4(input)
    target = 1
    input.sort!                       # in-place sorting?

    input.each do |x|                 # linear
        next if x <= 0 or x == target - 1
        break if x != target

        if x == target
            target += 1
        end
    end

    target
end
```
<br>

## **Explanation**

### O(n) / O(max(n, largest element in n))

First method uses the _set difference_.

Given two sets, `A` and `B`, `A - B` returns a set `C` where `C` contain unique elements of `A`. For example, given `A = [1,2,3]` and `B = [2, 3]`, `A - B` will give `[1]`. 

Lets take a look at the main part of the code.

```ruby
max = input.max
b = ([*1 .. max] - input)
```

We first find the largest element from the given array, `B`, and store it to `max`. Then we create our second set, `A`, which contain `[*0 ... max]`. Now when we perform `A - B`, the first element in `A` becomes the smallest positive number that is not in the given array, because we extracted all elements that exists.

Note, when all numbers are consecutive in the given array like `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, `A - B` will give you an empty array (or some other values than `5`) so you will need to check that value with an _if_ condition.

So we solved it; however, we failed to meet one of the criteria, O(1) space complexity.

Imagine our input was this `[1, 1,000,000,000]`; an array with two elements (_one_ and a _billion_) will result in me **creating a billion size array**. Can you imagine? I know stack wont be able to hold billion numbers but I gave it a try.

You can see from the above that there was an error; however, its not that simple. I really thought my laptop was gonna explodeðŸ’¢

### O(n) / O(1)
How should we improve the code so that we use constant space?

The problem is simple if given array is sorted. We just search for `1` and count.
If `1` does not exist, then our number is `1`.


Since its not sorted, we're going to sort the array. But careful here, we need to use in-place sorting. 

I used Ruby's `sort!` method. I'm not quite sure whether it really is in-place, but its not that hard to write your own in-place sort so lets just assume it is.

The below is the implementation for `sort!`. Let me know if I'm wrong that its not using any additional space.

```c
/* sort!() */
/* https://apidock.com/ruby/v2_5_5/Array/sort! */
VALUE
rb_ary_sort_bang(VALUE ary)
{
    rb_ary_modify(ary);
    assert(!ARY_SHARED_P(ary));
    if (RARRAY_LEN(ary) > 1) {
        VALUE tmp = ary_make_substitution(ary); /* only ary refers tmp */
        struct ary_sort_data data;
        long len = RARRAY_LEN(ary);

        RBASIC_CLEAR_CLASS(tmp);
        data.ary = tmp;
        data.cmp_opt.opt_methods = 0;
        data.cmp_opt.opt_inited = 0;
        RARRAY_PTR_USE(tmp, ptr, {
            ruby_qsort(ptr, len, sizeof(VALUE),
                       rb_block_given_p()?sort_1:sort_2, &data);
        }); /* WB: no new reference */
        rb_ary_modify(ary);
        if (ARY_EMBED_P(tmp)) {
            if (ARY_SHARED_P(ary)) { /* ary might be destructively operated in the given block */
                rb_ary_unshare(ary);
                FL_SET_EMBED(ary);
            }
            ary_memcpy(ary, 0, ARY_EMBED_LEN(tmp), ARY_EMBED_PTR(tmp));
            ARY_SET_LEN(ary, ARY_EMBED_LEN(tmp));
        }
        else {
            if (!ARY_EMBED_P(ary) && ARY_HEAP_PTR(ary) == ARY_HEAP_PTR(tmp)) {
                FL_UNSET_SHARED(ary);
                ARY_SET_CAPA(ary, RARRAY_LEN(tmp));
            }
            else {
                assert(!ARY_SHARED_P(tmp));
                if (ARY_EMBED_P(ary)) {
                    FL_UNSET_EMBED(ary);
                }
                else if (ARY_SHARED_P(ary)) {
                    /* ary might be destructively operated in the given block */
                    rb_ary_unshare(ary);
                }
                else {
                    ruby_sized_xfree((void *)ARY_HEAP_PTR(ary), ARY_HEAP_SIZE(ary));
                }
                ARY_SET_PTR(ary, RARRAY_CONST_PTR(tmp));
                ARY_SET_HEAP_LEN(ary, len);
                ARY_SET_CAPA(ary, RARRAY_LEN(tmp));
            }
            /* tmp was lost ownership for the ptr */
            FL_UNSET(tmp, FL_FREEZE);
            FL_SET_EMBED(tmp);
            ARY_SET_EMBED_LEN(tmp, 0);
            FL_SET(tmp, FL_FREEZE);
        }
        /* tmp will be GC'ed. */
        RBASIC_SET_CLASS_RAW(tmp, rb_cArray); /* rb_cArray must be marked */
    }
    return ary;
}
```
