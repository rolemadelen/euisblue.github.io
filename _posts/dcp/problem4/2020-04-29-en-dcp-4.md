## **DCP #4**

Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.

For example, the input [3, 4, -1, 1] should give 2. The input [1, 2, 0] should give 3.

You can modify the input array in-place.

## **Solution 1 - Naive**
This algorithm begins with the smallest positive integer which is `1`.
We compare this number with all the elements in the array and check if it exists. If it's not 
in the list, then this is our smallest positive integer. If not, we increment the number and 
repeat the process.

```rb
def dcp4_naive(arr)
  size = arr.size

  for i in 1..size
    if (arr.include? i) == false
      return i
    end
  end

  return size+1
end
```
Time Complexity:  **O(n^2)**<br>
Space Complexity: **O(1)**

I believe this algorithm is O(n^2) because of the `Array#include?` implementation.

```
rb_ary_includes(VALUE ary, VALUE item)
{
    long i;
    VALUE e;

    for (i=0; i<RARRAY_LEN(ary); i++) {
        e = RARRAY_AREF(ary, i);
        if (rb_equal(e, item)) {
            return Qtrue;
        }
    }
    return Qfalse;
}
```

## **Solution 2 - Hash**
Here I used a hash to bring down the time complexity from square to linear, because hash's 
lookup time is constant. However, this algorthim uses more space for the hash.

```rb
def dcp4_hash(arr)
  size = arr.size
  hash = Hash[arr.map {|x| [x, x]}]

  for i in 1..size
    if (hash.include? i) == false
      return i
    end
  end

  return size+1
end
```
Time Complexity:  **O(n)**<br>
Space Complexity: **O(n)**


## **Solution 3 - Partial Sort**

I had an idea of partially sorting the array but couldn't figure it out until I found a comment by 
<i>Idan Arye</i> in [this](https://dev.to/cwetanow/daily-coding-problem-4-4c3g) post.

I said <i>partial sort</i> but it's a figure of speech, because the time complexity will go up to
O(nlogn) at least if I used any sorting algorithm.

Basically what we're doing here is swapping the data so that they're in the right index. 
I used 1-based index, so if `arr[0]` is `3`, it'll be swapped with `arr[3]`. 
We continue this process with every number. This sounds like a square time complexity.

The key here is that we don't swap if that number is already in the right index or if that 
number is out of the range. And this makes our algorithm linear because we don't swap anymore 
once we've done it once. Perhaps, it's <i>amortized</i>.

```rb
def dcp4(arr)
  size = arr.size
  arr.push(0)

  out_of_range = ->(x) {
    return x < 1 || x > size
  }

  for i in 0...size
    while true
      break if out_of_range.call(arr[i])
      
      correct = arr[i]
      break if arr[correct] == arr[i]

      arr[i], arr[correct] = arr[correct], arr[i]
    end
  end

  for i in 1..size
    if arr[i] != i
      return i
    end
  end

  return arr[size]+1
end
```
Time Complexity:  **Amortized O(n)**<br>
Space Complexity: **O(1)**
