## 木構造とは

木構造（英:Tree; ツリー）は 一つまたは複数の**ノード** （英: node）で構成されている非線形データ構造です。

![Tree Terms](/img/in-post/ds-algo/tree/tree-terms.svg)

The top-most (first) node of the tree is called the **root** node. There is only one *root* in a tree and it can have either 
 0 or more **child** node(s).

<br>

A tree is actually a **graph**. It is an **acyclic connected graph**, meaning a graph, where all nodes are connected, without a cycle.

<br>

![Tree check](/img/in-post/ds-algo/tree/tree-cycle.svg)

The left figure is NOT a tree since it has a cycle. On the other hand, the right figure is a tree.

## 木構造の用語

| Terms  | Description  |
|:-----|:-----|
| **ノードの次数**<br>(degree) | The total number of children of that node. |
| **木の次数**<br>(degree) | The highest degree of a node in the tree. |
| **根ノード**<br>(root node) | The entry point or the first node of a tree.|
| **親ノード**<br>(parent node) | The node which has one or more children. |
| **子供** (child) | The node which is a descendant of some node. |
| **兄弟** (siblings) | Nodes which belong to the same parent. |
| **葉ノード**<br>(leaf node) | The node which does not have any child.|
| **枝** (edge) | The connecting link between any two nodes. |
| **レベル** (levels) | Each step from top to bottom is called as level of a tree. The level count starts with 0 and increments by 1 at each level. |
| **ノードの深さ**<br>(node)| Total number of edges from root node to a particular node. |
| **木の深さ**<br>(tree) | Total number of edges from root node to a leaf node in the longest path. |
| **ノードの高さ**<br>(height) | Total number of edges that lies on the longest path from any leaf node to a particular node. |
| **木の高さ**<br>(height)| The height of root node.|

## 特性
- There is one and only one path between any two nodes in a tree.
- A tree with `N` nodes havs exactly `N-1` edges.
- A graph is a tree if and only if minimally connected.

## 木構造の実装

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Node {
  public:
    int data;
    Node *left;
    Node *right;

    Node(int _data) : data(_data), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {;} 
};

int main() {
  Node *root = new Node(10);
  root->left = new Node(20);
  root->right = new Node(30);
  root->right->left = new Node(55);
  root->right->right = new Node(70);
  root->left->left = new Node(40);

  return 0;
}
```

Compile and run the code adove, it will generate the following tree.

## C/C++: Memory Deallocation

> Feel free to skip this part if you're using a language that handles the memory for you.


One way to delete all nodes in a tree is to use a recursion. I used a *preorder* traversal.
```cpp
void deleteTreeRec(Node *root) {
  if(!root) return;
  deleteTreeRec(root->left);
  deleteTreeRec(root->right);
  delete root;
}
```

<br>

We can also delete nodes level by level in a tree.

```cpp
void deleteTree(Node *root) {
  queue<Node *> q;
  q.push(root);

  while(!q.empty()) {
    Node *temp = q.front();
    q.pop();
    if(temp->left) q.push(temp->left);
    if(temp->right) q.push(temp->right);
    delete temp;
  }
}
```
