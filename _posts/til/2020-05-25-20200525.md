## TL;DR
- Ruby
  + rubygem

<div class="divider"></div>

## Ruby
### rubygem
starting making my second gem, [boj-solvedac.gem](https://github.com/jioneeu/boj-solvedac)

thougt about including `stats/` directory with the gem, but this wasn't possible.
when the code is trying to access certain directory, it started looking from where 
user is currently located at not the `lib/stat/`.

So instead, I uploaded these files to my git and used `curl` to grab this data.

probaby not the best idea, but ... can't think of any method to solve this yet.
