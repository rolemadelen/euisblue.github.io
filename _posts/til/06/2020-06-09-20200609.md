## Rails way to write RESTful Routes

```rb
# in config/routes.rb
'''
resources :posts
'''
```
This is it.  This adds all seven actions (index, show, new, create, edit, destroy, update).

<div class="divider"></div>

## Rails Routes and Route Helpers
```
# output all the routes your app knows
$ rails routes
```
example
```
edit_car GET    /cars/:id/edit(.:format)  cars#edit
car GET    /cars/:id(.:format)  cars#show
```

left most coulmn (`edit_car` and `car`) are 'name's of the route (**DON'T HARD CODE URLs**).

`(.:format)` simply means that it's not required to specify a file extension.

### Routes go to Controller Actions

Simple sample controller produced by `resources :posts`:

```rb
 # in app/controllers/posts
  class PostsController < ApplicationController

    def index
      # very simple code to grab all posts so they can be
      # displayed in the Index view (index.html.erb)
    end

    def show
      # very simple code to grab the proper Post so it can be
      # displayed in the Show view (show.html.erb)
    end

    def new
      # very simple code to create an empty post and send the user
      # to the New view for it (new.html.erb), which will have a
      # form for creating the post
    end

    def create
      # code to create a new post based on the parameters that
      # were submitted with the form (and are now available in the
      # params hash)
    end

    def edit
      # very simple code to find the post we want and send the
      # user to the Edit view for it(edit.html.erb), which has a
      # form for editing the post
    end

    def update
      # code to figure out which post we're trying to update, then
      # actually update the attributes of that post.  Once that's
      # done, redirect us to somewhere like the Show page for that
      # post
    end

    def destroy
      # very simple code to find the post we're referring to and
      # destroy it.  Once that's done, redirect us to somewhere fun.
    end
  end
```

### I don't want all seven routes!

use `only` to specify ones you want, or use `except` to not include ones you don't want.

```rb
resources :posts, only: [:index, :show]
resources :users, except: [:index]
```

### Non-RESTful Routes
There are times that you want to make up your own route and map it to your own controller action.

```rb
get '/somepath', to: 'somecontroller#someaction'
```

<div class="divider"></div>
