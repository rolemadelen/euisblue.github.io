## How to reverse a 'rails generate'
```sh
$ rails generate controller artcle
```

I made a typo. Lets delete this.

```sh
$ rails destroy controller artcle
```

and generate it again

```sh
$ rails  generate controller article
```

## shortcuts
- generate: `g`
- destroy: `d`

```sh
$ rails g controller article
$ rails d controller article
```
