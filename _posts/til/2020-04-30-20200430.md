# mv command 

One way to use `mv` command is to change the file name
```
$ mv foo.py foo.rb
```
This will change `foo.py` to `foo.rb`.

Here's a little trick to that
```
$ mv foo.{py, rb}
```
This will do the same thing.

# Fold Lines

1. Select lines you would like to fold with `shift + v`
2. `z`, `f`
