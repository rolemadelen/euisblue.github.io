## TL;DR
- JavaScript
  + Calculator

<div class="divider"></div>

## JavaScript
### Calculator
Can choose different bases.
![JS Calc](/assets/images/til/2020/0530-js-calc.png)

I can use `Number#toString` to convert numbers to different bases
```js
let val = 255;
val.toString(16)   // FF
val.toString(8)    // 377
val.toString(2)    // 11111111
```

For the binary though, seems like using `Number#toString(2)` is not good because it fails to handle negative numbers.
This is using `>>>` (unsigned right shift) to coerce the number to an unsigned integer.
```js
function toBinary(dec) {
	return (dec >>> 0).toString(2);
}
```

Also when I convert the numbers to different bases to display it in the calculator, I ignored the decimal parts.
For example `12.75` becomes `12` and this number will be converted to hex, oct, and binary. 
I was looking for something like `int(val)` but seems like there isn't one?
```js
let val = 12.75;
Math.floor(val);  // 12
```

## AtCoder
Attempted [Nomura Contest](https://atcoder.jp/contests/nomura2020).

A was easy. B was surprisingly easy.

Now C:Folia.

I thought about adding vertices from the end and add it back up.. I think I'm going to the right direction but, 
I'm adding some extra which I can't figure out at this moment. I'll look at the editorial later.
