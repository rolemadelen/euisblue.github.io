## Linear (naive) approach

Iterate all numbers from `1` to `n` and print it if a number divides `n`.

```rb
n = gets.to_i

1.upto(n) do |i|
  if n % i == 0
      puts i
  end
end
```

Time Complexity: **O(N)**

## Improved algorithm

Suppose that `n = 50`. Divisors are in pairs

```
(1, 50)
(2, 25)
(5, 10)
```

So it's sufficient to iterate only upto `sqrt(n)`.

And as you can see from the pairs above, numbers are printed in zig-zag fashion. 
To print them in sorted order, we save the latter number in a separate set (`50, 25, 10`). 
And print them in reversed order (`10, 25 50`).
```rb
n = gets.to_i
x = []

1.upto(Math.sqrt(n)) do |i|
  if n % i == 0
    if (n/i == i)
      puts i
    else 
      puts i
      x << n/i
    end
  end
end

x.size.downto(1) do |i|
    puts x[i-1]
end
```

Time Complexity: **O(sqrt(N))**
