                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asayake Taiko is a Japanese drumming group founded in the spring of 2002 at the University of California, San Diego. <br> <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asayake Taiko's mission statement is to increase Japanese cultural awareness both within and outside of the UCSD community through the art of taiko.

                <p class="history">
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spring of 2002, Bobby Koga, Reid Matsuoka and several other students came together to start a taiko group at the University of California, San Diego. With financial support from the university, the fledgling group purchased various equipment in order to construct the Japanese drums in garages of devoted members. In spring of 2004, Asayake Taiko at UCSD debuted with their completed drums at the 3rd Annual Nikkei Student Union Culture Show.
                    <br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Asayake Taiko performs for on-campus cultural events, high school conferences, and various university functions. Each year, Asayake Taiko continues to grow in equipment and members to accomplish its mission statement.
